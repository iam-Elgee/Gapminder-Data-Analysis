# Gapminder-Data-Analysis
This is the first Project in the Udacity Nano degree program. 

The task is to investigate a dataset in a project workflow that includes data gathering, wrangling, cleaning and exploratory analysis
I worked on the GAPMINDER dataset. link to webpage here (https://www.gapminder.org/data/)


The dataset includes records of countries and indicator values to measure trends in population growth, energy generation and use, and other useful indicators.


I investigated the data to analyse for trends and relationship between co2 emissions with energy generation and use.
Also, I investigated the data set to visulaize trends in the income level of countries over a period of years.
